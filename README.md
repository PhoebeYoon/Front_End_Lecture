```
.person { }       <- Block: The sole root of the component.   
.person__head { } <- Element: A component part of the Block.  
.person--tall { }  <- Modifier: A variant or extension of the Block.  
```
Elements are delimited with two (2) underscores (__), and Modifiers are delimited by two (2) hyphens (--).   

Here we can see that    
.person {} is the Block; it is the sole root of a discrete entity.    
.person__head {} is an Element; it is a smaller part of the .person {} Block. Finally,   
.person--tall {} is a Modifier; it is a specific variant of the .person {} Block.
